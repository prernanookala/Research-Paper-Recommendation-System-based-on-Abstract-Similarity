       "4  phonon polaritons (phps) in freestanding and supported multilayers (muls) of\\nhexagonal boron nitride (hbn) are systematically studied using a macroscopic\\noptical-phonon model. the php properties such as confinement, group velocity,\\npropagation quality factor (pqf) and wavelength scaling are studied. owing to\\nthe nonlocal high-frequency screening, there is an upper frequency limit making\\nthe two-dimensional (2d) phps have a frequency band, and also a maximum pqf\\noccurs near the centre frequency. the substrate's dielectric response should be\\nincluded to accurately calculate the php properties. while the simple\\nelectrostatic approximation (esa) is a proper treatment for php frequencies\\n$\\omega$ above $\\omega_0$ (e.g. $\\omega>1.03\\omega_0$ for the 30-layers;\\n$\\omega_0$ is the $\\gamma$ point optical phonon frequency), it fails to\\ndescribe the php properties near $\\omega_0$ and the effect of retardation\\nshould be included for an accurate description. the php wavelength versus the\\nlayer thickness near $\\omega_0$ deviates significantly from a linear scaling\\nlaw given by the esa due to strong phonon-photon coupling. the calculated php\\ndispersion, pqf and scaling are compared with experimental data of a number of\\nspectroscopic studies and good agreement is obtained. while the frequency of\\nincident light should be near the centre frequency to maximize the pqf, the php\\nwavelength, confinement and propagation length can be engineered by varying the\\nmul thickness and its dielectric environment.   \n",
